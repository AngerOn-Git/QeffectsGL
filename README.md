# QeffectsGL
**Version 1.3 (November 2016)**

OpenGL pseudo-driver that adds some graphical enhancements to OpenGL-based games. You should place opengl32.dll and QeffectsGL.ini to the game executable's directory before running the game. If the game has multiple renderers available (e.g. Half-Life, Unreal), OpenGL renderer must be switched to.

**NEVER**, you hear, **NEVER** replace system's OpenGL library `opengl32.dll`! This can break the whole enchilada, since QeffectsGL is NOT a complete replacement for OpenGL.
